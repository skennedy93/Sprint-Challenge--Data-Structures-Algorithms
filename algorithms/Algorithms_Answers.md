Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

 a) O(n) increases by n^2 until n^3 is reached
 

 b) O(n^3), 3 for loops are looping over n


 c) O(n),  runs through number of bunnies until the zero is returned

excersise 2

 start at n/2. If the egg breaks, go to the lower levels, and if the egg doesn't break, go to the higher levels. Loop until you get the floor that will break the least amount of eggs.
